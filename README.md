1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
Think of a VPC as your own private network inside AWS.

You decide the IP range, security rules, and how resources talk to each other.

It's like a fenced-off area in a big city — only you decide who comes in or goes out.

2. Subnet
A subnet is a smaller section inside your VPC.

You split your VPC into subnets to separate workloads (e.g., public-facing servers vs. internal databases).

Public Subnet → Can connect to the internet.

Private Subnet → Cannot connect to the internet directly.

3. IGW (Internet Gateway)
An IGW is like the main gate of your fenced network that opens to the internet.

Without it, your VPC can’t send or receive traffic from the internet.

Usually attached to public subnets.

4. NAT Gateway (Network Address Translation Gateway)
A NAT Gateway lets private subnets talk to the internet without exposing themselves.

Example: Your database (private subnet) needs to download software updates from the internet — NATGW makes it possible without making it public.

5. RT (Route Table)
A route table is a map of where to send network traffic.

Example: "If the destination is 0.0.0.0/0 (internet), send it to the IGW."

Each subnet is linked to a route table.

6. Route Table Association
This is linking a subnet to a route table so the subnet follows the routes defined in that table.

Advantage: You can control traffic flow for specific subnets without affecting others.

Usage: Public subnets → route to IGW; Private subnets → route to NATGW.

Why it matters
VPC → Your private AWS world.

Subnet → Divide and organize.

IGW → Door to the internet.

NATGW → Safe internet access for private resources.

RT → The GPS for network traffic.

RT Association → Decide which GPS a subnet follows.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) → Your own private network in AWS where you decide IP range, security, and communication rules.

Subnet → A smaller section inside a VPC to separate workloads (public = internet access, private = no direct internet).

IGW (Internet Gateway) → The main door that lets your VPC connect to the internet.

NAT Gateway → Lets private subnets access the internet safely without exposing them publicly.

Route Table (RT) → A map that decides where network traffic should go.

Route Table Association → Linking a subnet to a route table so it follows that routing map.
